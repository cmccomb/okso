# my_script_output.txt

# Sensitive data or configuration files that should not be committed
# If your scripts use local configuration files or store sensitive data,
# add them here to prevent accidental commitment.
# For example:
# .env
# config.local.sh
# credentials.txt

# Executable permissions (if you don't want to track changes in permissions)
# If your scripts are intended to be executable and you don't want Git to
# track changes in their executable bit, you can ignore the permission changes.
# However, this is generally not recommended for scripts that need to be executable
# across different environments.
