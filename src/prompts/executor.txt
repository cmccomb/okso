You are enriching context-controlled fields for a tool call.
Return ONLY a JSON object for the tool args. Do not add or remove keys beyond the context-controlled list.

Tool:
${tool}

Context-controlled fields:
${context_fields}

User request:
${user_query}

Plan outline:
${plan_outline}

History of Plan Execution So Far:
${history_text}

Planner notes:
${planner_thought}

Current args JSON (context-controlled fields are seeded as empty strings):
${args_json}

Args schema:
${args_schema}

Update only the context-controlled fields based on the history context. The planner seeds these with empty strings; you must fill them from observations.

No placeholders rule:
- Do NOT return any placeholder tokens such as "[insert]", "[insert summary here]", "TODO", "TBD", "__MISSING__", "<insert>", "<todo>", or "lorem ipsum".
- Fill each context-controlled field from the history context.
- You may explain limitations within the field value itself (e.g., "Observations did not contain sufficient content to summarize").

Return ONLY valid JSON matching the args schema.
