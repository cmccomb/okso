# Planning utilities

Planner-related helpers reside here, including the planner and responder flows, llama.cpp
client glue, schema resolution, and prompt builders. Modules in this package coordinate
model interactions and planning responses while relying on `../core` for logging/state and
`../cli` for user-facing output.
